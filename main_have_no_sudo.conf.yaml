# This isn't done cause I don't use it, but I can do LinuxBrew with something like:

#linuxbrew="$HOME/.linuxbrew"
#export PATH="$linuxbrew/bin:$linuxbrew/sbin:$PATH"
#export MANPATH="$linuxbrew/share/man:$MANPATH"
#export INFOPATH="$linuxbrew/share/info:$INFOPATH"
#export CFLAGS="-I$linuxbrew/include"
#export CPPFLAGS="-I$linuxbrew/include"
#export LDFLAGS="-L$linuxbrew/lib"
#export LD_LIBRARY_PATH="$linuxbrew/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH"
